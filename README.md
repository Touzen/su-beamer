su-beamer: an unofficial beamer template for Stockholm University
===============================================================

This project defines a beamer template that roughly follows the Stockholm University style guide. The template has not been sanctioned or endorsed by the university.

The template is based on the [KTH-PQ](https://github.com/th-rtyf-re/kthpq) template created for KTH presentations.
